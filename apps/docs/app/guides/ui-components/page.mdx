# UI Components

AgileSpace provides a shared UI component library that ensures consistency across all applications in the project.

## Getting Started

The UI components are available in the `@workspace/ui` package, which is already included as a dependency in all applications within the monorepo.

To use a component, import it from the package:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@workspace/ui';

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Button variant="default">Click me</Button>
  );
}
```

## Available Components

### Button

The Button component is used to trigger actions.

```tsx
<Button variant="default">Default</Button>
<Button variant="destructive">Destructive</Button>
<Button variant="outline">Outline</Button>
<Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>
<Button variant="ghost">Ghost</Button>
<Button variant="link">Link</Button>
```

## Utility Functions

The UI package also provides utility functions to help with common tasks.

### cn

The `cn` utility is a wrapper around `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`, which helps to conditionally apply Tailwind CSS classes without conflicts:

```tsx
import { cn } from '@workspace/ui';

export function MyComponent({ className }) {
  return (
    <div className={cn('bg-blue-500 p-4', className)}>
      Content
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Customization

You can customize the UI components by extending the Tailwind configuration in your app.
